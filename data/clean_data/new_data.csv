Students will define the scope of the problem, develop a solution plan, produce a working implementation, and present their work using written, oral, and (if suitable) video reports. Class time will focus on the project, but may include some lectures. The class will be small and highly interactive. Project themes change each year. Contact the Computer Science Undergraduate Office for information about this year’s topic themes, required preparation, and course enrolment procedures. Not eligible for CR/NCR option. A refundable deposit of $90 will be charged for the use of Arduino kit in lab activities. Students must submit an application to the course describing relevant interests, experience, and skills and general academic history. Application questions are set and assessed by the instructor. Applications from St. George students enrolled in a Computer Science program or the Data Science Specialist program will be considered first. Applications by students from other programs with appropriate prerequisites will be considered as space permits. Please visit https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/221753/pages/400-level-course-balloting-and-applications for application deadlines and details. A decision on your application will be confirmed approximately 2-3 weeks after the application deadline, so students should enrol in an alternate course until the results of their application are confirmed."
